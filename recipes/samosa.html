    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Samosa is a popular Indian snack consisting of a crispy, golden-brown pastry filled with a spiced mixture of mashed potatoes, peas, and various herbs. The outer layer is made from all-purpose flour, rolled thin, and shaped into a triangular pocket before being deep-fried until perfectly crisp. Samosas are often served with tangy tamarind chutney or mint chutney, making them a delightful appetizer or tea-time snack that’s loved by many.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For the dough</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour (maida)</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons oil or ghee</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon carom seeds (ajwain)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Water (as needed to knead the dough)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the filling</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large potatoes, boiled and mashed</li>
        <li>½ cup green peas (fresh or frozen)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
        <li>1–2 green chilies, finely chopped (optional for heat)</li>
        <li>A handful of fresh coriander leaves, chopped</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, carom seeds, salt, and oil/ghee. Mix well until crumbly.</li>
        <li>Add water gradually and knead into a smooth, firm dough. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>For the filling, heat a little oil in a pan, add cumin seeds, and let them splutter.</li>
        <li>Add the boiled potatoes, green peas, garam masala, coriander powder, green chilies, and salt. Mix well and cook for a few minutes. Remove from heat and let it cool.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into small balls. Roll each ball into a thin oval shape.</li>
        <li>Cut the oval in half to form two semi-circles. Take one semi-circle, fold it into a cone shape, sealing the edge with water.</li>
        <li>Fill the cone with the potato-pea mixture and seal the open edge by pressing it firmly.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat. Fry the samosas until golden brown and crisp on all sides.</li>
        <li>Drain on paper towels and serve hot with chutney or sauce of your choice.</li>
    </ol>
