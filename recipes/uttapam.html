    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Uttapam is a delicious South Indian savory pancake made from a fermented batter of rice and urad dal (black gram). Unlike the crisp dosa, uttapam has a soft, fluffy texture and is topped with vibrant vegetables like onions, tomatoes, green chilies, and coriander leaves. The batter is poured thick onto a hot griddle and cooked slowly, allowing the vegetables to lightly caramelize while the pancake turns golden. Often enjoyed with coconut chutney and sambar, uttapam makes for a hearty breakfast or satisfying snack that’s packed with flavor and nutrition.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For the batter</h4>
    <ul>
        
        <li>1 cup rice</li>
        <li>half cup udad dal</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon fenugreek seeds (optional, helps fermentation)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Water (for soaking and grinding)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the topping</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 small tomato, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1–2 green chilies, finely chopped (optional for heat)</li>
        <li>A handful of fresh coriander leaves, chopped</li>
        <li>Grated carrot or capsicum (optional but adds extra color & nutrition)</li>
        <li>Oil or ghee for cooking</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the rice and urad dal (and fenugreek seeds if using) in water for at least 4–6 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Drain the soaked ingredients and blend them into a smooth batter, adding water as needed to achieve a thick but pourable consistency.</li>
        <li>Ferment the batter in a warm place for 8–12 hours until it rises and becomes slightly bubbly.</li>
        <li>Once fermented, stir the batter gently and add salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or tawa over medium heat and grease it lightly with oil or ghee.</li>
        <li>Pour a ladleful of batter onto the skillet, spreading it into a thick pancake shape.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the chopped vegetables evenly over the top of the batter.</li>
        <li>Cook on medium heat until the bottom is golden brown, about 3–4 minutes. Flip carefully and cook the other side for another 2–3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with coconut chutney and sambar.</li>
