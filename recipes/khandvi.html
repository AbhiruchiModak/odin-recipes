    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Khandvi is a popular Gujarati snack made from gram flour (besan) and yogurt, known for its delicate, rolled-up appearance and savory flavor. The batter is cooked until it reaches a smooth, spreadable consistency, then spread thinly on a surface to cool. Once set, it is cut into strips and rolled up tightly. Khandvi is typically seasoned with mustard seeds, sesame seeds, and garnished with fresh coriander. It’s a delightful snack that’s both light and flavorful, often enjoyed with green chutney.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For the batter</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup gram flour (besan)</li>
        <li>1 cup yogurt</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ginger-green chili paste</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the tempering</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mustard seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame seeds (optional)</li>
        <li>A pinch of asafoetida (hing)</li>
        <li>Fresh coriander leaves, chopped (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine gram flour, yogurt, water, turmeric powder, ginger-green chili paste, and salt. Whisk until smooth and lump-free.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into a non-stick pan and cook on low heat, stirring continuously to avoid lumps. Cook until the batter thickens and starts to leave the sides of the pan.</li>
        <li>Spread the cooked batter evenly on a greased surface or parchment paper. Let it cool for a few minutes until set.</li>
        <li>Once set, cut the batter into strips (about 1 inch wide) and roll each strip tightly from one end to the other.</li>
        <li>For tempering, heat oil in a small pan, add mustard seeds and let them splutter. Add sesame seeds and asafoetida, then remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the tempering over the rolled khandvi and garnish with chopped coriander leaves.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with green chutney or as a snack.</li>
    </ol>
